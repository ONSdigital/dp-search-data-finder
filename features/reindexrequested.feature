Feature: ReindexRequested

#TODO This scenario is not currently required but may need to be implemented before the next release
#Scenario: Posting and checking a response
#When these reindex-requested events are consumed:
#  | JobID |   SearchIndex |   TraceID |
#  | 1234  |   ons         |   ed12323eddd3232 |
#Then I should receive a reindex-requested response
